### About me

My name is Joel.  I'm a freelance javascript developer who loves building stuff with React, Redux, Node, GraphQL, and Postgres.

I am currently in Prague, Czech Republic, but am headed back to Boulder, Colorado in July.  We have been in Prague for a year, and love it, but we miss the skiing and sunshine of the Rockies.

I have 8 years of experience making software.  I've done native and web applications in .NET, mobile iOS apps, but in recent years I've settled in nicely as a full-stack javascript developer (this doesn't mean I'm not open to learning new technologies; I tend to throw myself whole-heartedly into whatever I'm doing).  I'm available for contracts or full-time if the situation is right and would love to hear from you (see the bottom of the page).
